# Silent-Auction-Bidder
Welcome to the Silent Auction Bidder!  This Python program allows users to participate in a silent auction by placing their bids anonymously. The program tracks bids and determines the highest bidder once the auction closes.

# Features

- **Anonymous Bidding:** Participants can enter their names and bid amounts without revealing their identities.
- **Winner Announcement:** Automatically determines and announces the highest bidder and their bid amount.
- **Interactive User Experience:** Simple prompts guide users throughout the bidding process.

## How It Works

1. Participants are prompted to enter their names and bid amounts.
2. Users can indicate if there are more bidders or if they are done bidding.
3. When the auction closes, the program identifies and displays the highest bidder.

# Usage
* Enter your name and bid amount when prompted.
* Indicate if there are more bidders or if you wish to end the bidding.
* At the end of the bidding, the program will display the highest bidder.
